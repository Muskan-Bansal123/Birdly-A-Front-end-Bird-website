              <h3>1.Choosing the Right Bird</h3>
            </u> <br>Selecting the right bird depends on your living situation, time availability, and personal
            preferences. Here are a few common pet birds:
            <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Parakeets (Budgies): Small, colorful, and great for beginners.</li>
            <li>Cockatiels: Friendly and easy to care for, with a range of charming vocalizations.</li>
            <li>Canaries: Known for their singing and relatively independent nature.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

              <h3>2. Bird Housing</h3>
            </u> <br>A proper cage is essential for your bird's well-being.
            <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Cage Size: Ensure the cage is large enough for the bird to move around comfortably. It should be at
              least 2-3 times the size of your bird's wingspan when fully spread.</li>
            <li>Cage Materials: Choose a cage made of non-toxic materials. Avoid cages with lead or zinc-based paints.
            </li>
            <li>Perches: Provide a variety of perches of different diameters to keep your bird's feet healthy. Avoid
              smooth perches, as they can lead to foot problems.</li>
            <li>Toys and Enrichment: Birds need mental stimulation. Provide chew toys, puzzles, swings, and foraging
              opportunities to keep them busy.</li>
          </ul>

              <h3>3.Feeding Your Bird</h3>
            </u>
          <ul>
            <li>Pellets: A nutritious base for their diet.</li>
            <li>Fruits and Vegetables: Offer fresh, safe fruits (e.g., apples, berries) and vegetables (e.g., spinach,
              carrots).</li>
            <li>Seeds: In moderation, as they are high in fat.</li>
            <li>Water: Provide fresh water daily.</li>
          </ul>

            </u>
          <ul>
            <li>Feather Care: Most birds preen themselves, but help if needed.</li>
            <li>Bathing: Offer a shallow dish of water or mist your bird with a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Nail Trimming: Trim nails regularly to avoid overgrowth.</li>
            <li>Beak Care: Birds naturally wear down their beaks; consult a vet if overgrown.</li>
